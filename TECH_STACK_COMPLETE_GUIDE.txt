1. FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES
===========================================================

üîµ REACT 18 (JavaScript Library)
----------------------------------
What it is: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs)
Why we use it: Makes building interactive websites easier and faster
How it works: 
- Creates reusable components (like LEGO blocks for websites)
- Automatically updates the webpage when data changes
- Makes the app feel fast and responsive

Key Features in our project:
- Functional Components: Modern way of writing React code
- React Hooks: useState, useEffect, useCallback for managing data and side effects
- Component Lifecycle: How components are created, updated, and destroyed

Example: Our Chat component uses React to automatically update messages when users type

üîµ REACT ROUTER (Navigation)
-----------------------------
What it is: Handles navigation between different pages in our app
Why we use it: Allows users to go from Chat page to Admin page without page refresh
How it works: Changes what users see without loading a new webpage

Pages in our app:
- /chat - Main chat interface
- /admin - Knowledge base management  
- /analytics - Usage statistics
- /settings - Configuration
- /college-admin - File management

üîµ JAVASCRIPT ES6+ (Programming Language)
-----------------------------------------
What it is: The programming language that makes our website interactive
Why this version: ES6+ has modern features that make coding easier and cleaner

Key features we use:
- Arrow Functions: (param) => { code } - shorter way to write functions
- Destructuring: const { name, age } = person - extract data easily
- Template Literals: `Hello ${name}` - insert variables into strings
- Async/Await: Handle API calls cleanly
- Modules: import/export - organize code in separate files

üîµ JSX (JavaScript XML)
-----------------------
What it is: A syntax that lets us write HTML-like code inside JavaScript
Why we use it: Makes React components easier to read and write
How it works: Converts HTML-like syntax to regular JavaScript

Example:
const WelcomeMessage = () => {
  return <h1>Welcome to Campus Assist!</h1>;
}
